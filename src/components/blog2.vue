						Swami Vivekananda was a Hindu monk and a key figure in the introduction of Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world. He was born in Calcutta, India in 1863 and founded the Ramakrishna Math and Mission. Vivekananda's teachings emphasized the unity of all religions, and he spoke about the importance of self-realization, meditation, and service to humanity. He was a great orator and delivered several powerful speeches, including his famous address at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893, which brought him international recognition. Rabindranath Tagore, on the other hand, was a renowned Indian poet, philosopher, and Nobel laureate. He was the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature, and his works are known for their poetic beauty and philosophical depth. Tagore was also a social reformer who worked towards education for all and the promotion of Indian art and culture. While both Vivekananda and Tagore were influential figures in Indian history, they had different areas of focus and contributed to Indian society in their unique ways. India is a vast and diverse country located in South Asia, known for its rich history, diverse cultures, vibrant traditions, and bustling cities. With a population of over 1.3 billion people, India is the second-most populous country in the world, after China. The country is also the seventh-largest country by land area, with a diverse landscape that ranges from the Himalayan Mountains in the north to the tropical beaches of the south. India is home to a variety of religions, including Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism, and Jainism, among others. These diverse religions have contributed to India's cultural heritage, with numerous festivals, customs, and traditions that are celebrated throughout the country. Diwali, Holi, and Eid are some of the most popular festivals in India, which bring people together from different religions and cultures.
